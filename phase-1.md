# Phase 1

{% hint style="success" %}
**SOLVED** as of May 26, 2021
{% endhint %}

On April 1, 2021, dbrand started selling face masks again. You were able to add a "Surprise" to your purchase for an extra 10 USD, which turned out to be a robot camo mask.

Once the face masks started getting delivered after they shipped on April 12, 2021, they included cards that look like the following

Front and Back of the cards
{% endembed %}

Using the Zodiac Z340 Cipher the back text decrypts to `POSTANDSEARCHONTWITTER`. This is the same on every card. On the front of the card there is a singular Zodiac Killer Symbol. These can vary and we were looking for such symbols!

{% hint style="info" %}
Located on the front of the mask bags there was also a single pigpen symbol with a Robot Camo backing to denote the size of mask. There is also pigpen text on the back of the bags, which tells you how to wash the mask. This didn't have anything to do with phase 1.
{% endhint %}

We have a bunch of dipshits on Discord that have been trying to figure out what exactly the backs of the cards are supposed to mean.

~~If you have a symbol please post the image in the~~ [~~Discord~~](https://discord.gg/dbrand) ~~or~~ [~~Subreddit~~](https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand)~~!, additionally you can post it on Twitter using~~ [~~#CTC2~~](https://twitter.com/hashtag/CTC2)~~.~~ **UPDATE**: we have all the symbols and no longer need people to follow these steps

Cards that have been collected so far can be seen [here](https://github.com/Complete-the-Code/ctc2-phase-1/blob/master/acquiredSymbols).
